# Data Preprocessing Pipeline

This repository contains a basic yet complete preprocessing pipeline for machine learning projects using Python and Scikit-learn. It covers key steps such as handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and train-test splitting.

## 📁 File

- **preprocessing.py**  
  The main script that reads a dataset, preprocesses the features, and prepares the data for training and validation.
- **Data.csv**
  The data set that used in this project.

## 🔧 What It Does

✔️ Loads a dataset  
✔️ Fills missing values using the mean strategy  
✔️ One-hot encodes categorical independent variables  
✔️ Label-encodes the target variable  
✔️ Splits the dataset into training and validation sets  
✔️ Applies feature scaling to numerical features  

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional, imported but not used in this script)
